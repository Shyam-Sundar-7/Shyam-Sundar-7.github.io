  - Thoroughly examined customer behavior and other relevant features through a process of data visualization and data cleaning. This ensured the availability of accurate and high-quality data for the modeling task.  
  - Achieved an impressive prediction accuracy of **80%** by harnessing the robust capabilities of the **LightGBM** algorithm, optimizing its performance through hyperparameter tuning.
  - Streamlined the entire model deployment process using **Flask** and **Docker**, facilitating model delivery on the **Azure Container App** platform, optimizing operations and enhancing scalability.
