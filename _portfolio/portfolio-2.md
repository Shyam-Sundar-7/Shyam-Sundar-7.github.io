- Implemented a **Streamlit**-based user interface designed for seamless interaction, enabling users to query and receive relevant offers instantly. This approach significantly enhanced user experience and engagement on e-commerce sites.
- Utilized a custom-built dataset, structured in a CSV file, to simulate real-world e-commerce scenarios. This dataset was integral in giving knoweldge based responce by incorporating **Langchain**.
- Integrated **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** to optimize the recommendation process. By using vector database technology, the system could swiftly match user queries with the most relevant offers, thereby reducing screen time and streamlining decision-making.
