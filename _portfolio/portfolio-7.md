- Utilized various data cleaning and processing techniques, including boxplots, to identify and remove outliers, ensuring the quality and reliability of the dataset.
- Discovered that products with average ratings and belonging to animal categories other than birds exhibited higher repeat purchase patterns among customers. 
- Arrived at a strategic approach to increase sales by reducing the pricing structure for medium-sized products to below **$30**, effectively targeting **potential repeat buyers**.
