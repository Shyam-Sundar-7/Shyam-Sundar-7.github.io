  - Utilized the **OxAISH-AL-LLM/wiki_toxic** dataset from Hugging Face for model training, taking advantage of a pre-existing **BERT** model. Fine-tuned the last layer and added an additional output layer with two neurons for classification.
  - Delivered outstanding results with an exceptional accuracy of **91.95%**, a testament to the rigorous training and evaluation processes involved.
  - Implemented model deployment through **Flask** and **Docker**, ensuring scalability and ease of integration for content filtration solutions.
