- Explored a dataset related to **AIS marine** activity, with data recorded between **January 1, 2022, and January 15, 2022**, featuring a total of **17** unique attributes.
- Formulated a **statistical method** to analyze cargo ship vessels by considering time difference and speed over the ground for robust anomaly detection.
- Engineered a path prediction algorithm using a **sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism**, delivering a substantial **90%** reduction in error compared to Deep LSTM and GRU models.
