Conducted an extensive investigation of a **Milling machine** to proactively identify and prevent machine failures, focusing on enhancing operational reliability.


**Technical stack Used in the Project** - <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/azure/azure-original.svg" width ="16" height="100%" />

- Analyzed the dataset comprising **10,000** data points, featuring **14** distinct machine-specific features, to identify potential failures and optimize machine performance.
- Leveraged a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, culminating in an impressive **97\%** recall rate for predicting machine failures. This achievement was made possible through the strategic application of **logistic regression** and addressing class imbalance with the **SMOTE** approach.
- Skillfully managed in **Azure Designer**, within Azure Machine Learning Workspaces, showcasing the capacity to construct machine learning pipelines for in-depth data analysis and predictive modeling.
